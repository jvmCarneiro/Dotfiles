This theme was ported from "elementary" to Claws-Mail by Simon Steinbeiss <simon@xfce.org>.
Some icons were taken directly from the original (version 2.5 and bzr), some were modified, others reworked (e.g. *_hrm.png) and a few more were created from scratch.

elementary is developed by Daniel Foré <Daniel.p.Fore@gmail.com>, so credit goes to him.

elementary is licensed under GPL2 and so is this package.
